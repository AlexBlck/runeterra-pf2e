Once you’ve selected a threat level, it’s time to build the encounter. You have an XP budget based on the threat, and each creature costs some of that budget. Start with the monsters or NPCs that are most important to the encounter, then decide how you want to use the rest of your XP budget. Many encounters won’t match the XP budget exactly, but they should come close. The XP budget is based on a group of four characters. If your group is larger or smaller, see Different Party Sizes on page 76.

## Table 10-1: Encounter Budget

| **Threat** | **XP Budget** | **Character Adjustment** |
| ---------- | ------------- | ------------------------ |
| Trivial    | 40 or less    | 10 or less               |
| Low        | 60            | 20                       |
| Moderate   | 80            | 20                       |
| Severe     | 120           | 30                       |
| Extreme    | 160           | 40                       |
