**Setting:** Runeterra, Ionia
**BBEG:** Master Kusho
**PCs:** [[K]], [[Isa]], [[Miyamoto]], [[Xhokar]]
## Master Kusho
Master [[Kusho]], has decided to join [[Zed]] in the [[Shadow Order]], but became progressively corrupted by the Tears of Shadow. Now, he is seeking to unite all of Ionia under one banner to enact revenge on Noxus for their invasion. However, he believes that in order to do so he needs to instil fear in Ionians, to convince them to drop their pacifism.
Several factors have lead to his plan:
- He has recently learned that [[Omikayalan]] has started growing again.
- After an attack on [[Hirana Monastery]], he acquired an artifact that can suck the energy out of plant spirits in order to summon azakana, leaving the plant spirit corrupted in the process.
- After some experimentation, he realised that the artifact's power will be much stronger during the [[Spirit Blossom Festival]], when the connection between the worlds is much stronger.
### The plan
So, his big plan is as follows: during Spirit Blossom, extract the energy out of the God-Willow sapling in order to summon the Demon of Fear, Fiddlesticks. The summoning requires harnessing the energy in several regions of Ionia: 6 lesser ones and 3 Major. Lesser ones are handled by his Lieutenants. The locations draw the Demon's symbol on the map of Ionia, with the seventh outer circle being the location of the [[Omikayalan]].

## Minor Locations
Kusho's lieutenants in minor locations gather power, eliminate opposition and corrupt powerful creatures to join their side.
- Jhin, whom he freed from imprisonment.
	- **Thanze** - Jhin has positioned himself on a nearby farm, overlooking the shore. While there, he sucks out the energy of a water spirit that served as a source of water for the farm's fields. He uses this energy to charge his weapon's shots with corruptive power. Additionally, the water from the corrupted water spirit seeps into the plants and they wonder off, corrupted. The game begins when the players meet these corrupted plant on a road nearby. After defeating them, they return to the village. Later that day the players witness an assassination of the town's leader, as Jhin fires three corrupting shots into fey spirits and the fourth final shot into the town's leader. The fey fly away and the leader is dead.
	- **Weh'le** - Jhin attempts a dramatic escape to Piltover, right under the noses of Zed and Shen.
- A Noxian general, that's been leaking information to Kusho.
    - ![[Pasted image 20240826213659.png|right|200]]**Fae'lor** - A Noxian stronghold and the location of demonology scripts that contain the information on Fiddlesticks and other demons. 
- Lieutenant 3, please suggest good ideas.
    - **[[Puboe]]** is a human town located in the northern parts of the Shon-Xan region of Ionia. Xayah and Rakan freed several vastaya from a prison, controlled by Shadow Order disciples.
- Lieutenant 4
	 - Location 2 - Someone is corrupting a bunch of treants and other plant-based creatures, creating an army.
- Lieutenant 5
	 - **The Lasting Altar:** something to do with Karma.

## Major Locations
- [[Temple of Thanjuul]], where Kusho shares his plans with Zed and Zed refuses to help and fights back.  
- [[Temple of Koeshin]], where he plans to attack while Shen is away, counting on the fact that Shen will go looking for Jhin once he hears he's out of the prison again.
- [[Placidium of Navori]], the capital city, under Irelia's protection. Some sort of political intrigue or silent chase quest.
  
## Assault on the Greenglade
During the Spirit Blossom festival, Kusho, surviving Lieutenants and the corrupted creatures attack the Greenglade to use the God-Willow's power to summon Fiddlesticks. 
The fight has multiple stages, with the battlefield gradually mowing towards the stump of the tree.

Fiddlesticks power depends on the number of corruption points, accumulated throughout the game. All minor sites contribute **1 point** and major sites contribute **2 points**, for a total of 12. If Kusho successfully reaches the tree - Fiddlesticks is summoned at max power. Otherwise

| Corruption Points | Fiddlesticks Power |
| ----------------- | ------------------ |
| 0-2               | Weakened           |
| 3-5               | Standard           |
| 6-8               | Empowered          |
| 8-12              | Apocalyptic        |
