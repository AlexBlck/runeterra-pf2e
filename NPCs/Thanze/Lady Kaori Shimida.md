| [[Session Notes/Session 1.md\|Session 1]] | [[Higgs]] arrived to [[Thanze]] on the same ship as [[Lady Kaori Shimida]].                                                                                                      |
| [[Session Notes/Session 1.md\|Session 1]] | [[Higgs]], [[Lady Kaori Shimida]], [[Isa]], [[K]], [[L]], [[Miyamoto]] and [[Xhokar]] met at the [[Crossroads]] near [[Thanze]].                                                 |
| [[Session Notes/Session 1.md\|Session 1]] | They defended [[Lady Kaori Shimida]] from an ambush of violent spirits, inhabiting trees and pumpkins.                                                                           |
| [[Session Notes/Session 1.md\|Session 1]] | [[K]] handed a scroll over to [[Lady Kaori Shimida]], which she promised to read once the situation allows.                                                                      |
| [[Session Notes/Session 1.md\|Session 1]] | [[Lady Kaori Shimida]] gave them gold as a token of gratitude and invited them as honoured guests to [[Thanze]].                                                                 |
| [[Session Notes/Session 1.md\|Session 1]] | They met the assistant of [[Lady Kaori Shimida\|Lady Kori]], an elderly woman named Fa'lin.                                                                                      |
| [[Session Notes/Session 1.md\|Session 1]] | They peeped into the planner and found out that [[Lady Kaori Shimida\|Lady Kaori]] just returned from [[Noxus]] controlled part of the land.                                     |
| [[Session Notes/Session 1.md\|Session 1]] | [[K]] insisted that [[Lady Kaori Shimida]] reads the letter now. However, she was already preparing for the ceremony and promised to read it first thing next morning.           |
| [[Session Notes/Session 2.md\|Session 2]] | During her speech, [[Lady Kaori Shimida]] revealed that she is planning to sign a ceasefire with [[Noxus]] to prevent further bloodshed and help up a scroll with the agreement. |
| [[Session Notes/Session 2.md\|Session 2]] | Despite the attempts to protect her, the fourth shot struck [[Lady Kaori Shimida]].                                                                                              |
| [[Session Notes/Session 2.md\|Session 2]] | They summoned an aquatic monster, stole a scroll from [[Lady Kaori Shimida\|Lady Kaori's]] body and escaped.                                                                     |
| [[Session Notes/Session 2.md\|Session 2]] | No [[Shadow Order]] members were present, either. Even though [[Lady Kaori Shimida\|Lady Kaori]] mentioned that [[Zed\|Master Zed]] himself might attend the ceremony.           |
