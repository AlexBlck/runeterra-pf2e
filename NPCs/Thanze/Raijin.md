Raijin is an ancient Ionian Spirit residing within a suit of animated armor. The armor is adorned with intricate carvings resembling swirling winds and water. Though lacking a physical form, Raijin's presence is felt through the ethereal glow emanating from the armor's eye slits. A soft, echoing voice carries the wisdom of centuries.
