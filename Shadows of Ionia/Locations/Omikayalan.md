**Omikayalan**, known also as the **Heart of the World** or the **Greenglade**, is a sacred grove to all Ionians which is located in [[Navori]].

# History
The vastayashai'rei protected its most important landmark: the God-Willow, a massive tree, dripping with long gossamer leaves that shimmered with golden-green light. During ancient times, a battle between the groves protectors and [[Freljord|Freljordian]] warriors ended with the God-Willow's destruction. The whimpers of countless beasts, the bawling of rivers, the howling of trees and the dripping tears of moss, they lamented the God-Willow's death in a symphony of mourning.

Eventually a sapling would rise from the dead trunks of the God-Willow, which is protected by a group of spirits and druids, led spirit god known as [[Sai'nen Thousand-Tailed]].
