Hanako, a lively Yordle, has vibrant, flame-red fur covering her small stature. Her large, expressive eyes are a deep shade of green, and they sparkle with infectious energy. She wears a colorful apron adorned with tiny bottles and shakers, and her small, nimble hands expertly craft unique cocktails that match her enthusiastic personality.
