## Biography
Born in a small village in the northern mountains of [[Shon-Xan]], not too far from the town of [[Puboe]]. The village was massacred when K was little. She saved a lonely Jeweled Protector cub, named them [[L]] and they travelled together, stumbling upon the [[Garden of Dreaming#Dreaming Tree|Dreaming Tree]] and its protector, [[Lillia]]. She and [[L]] have stayed in the Garden, learning from [[Lillia]] and other spirits to protect themselves with both fangs and magic.



## Recent Events

> [!warning]- Spoilers
>  - [[Lillia]] showed K that a sapling has risen from the dead trunks of [[Omikayalan|God-Willow Tree]], urging her to share that information with [[Lady Kaori Shimida]], leader of [[Thanze]].

| [[Session Notes/Session 1.md\|Session 1]] | [[Higgs]], [[Lady Kaori Shimida]], [[Isa]], [[K]], [[L]], [[Miyamoto]] and [[Xhokar]] met at the [[Crossroads]] near [[Thanze]].                                                    |
| [[Session Notes/Session 1.md\|Session 1]] | [[K]] handed a scroll over to [[Lady Kaori Shimida]], which she promised to read once the situation allows.                                                                         |
| [[Session Notes/Session 1.md\|Session 1]] | [[K]] and [[Higgs]] visited the [[Town Hall]].                                                                                                                                      |
| [[Session Notes/Session 1.md\|Session 1]] | [[K]] insisted that [[Lady Kaori Shimida]] reads the letter now. However, she was already preparing for the ceremony and promised to read it first thing next morning.              |
| [[Session Notes/Session 1.md\|Session 1]] | She gave [[K]] and others permission to act as her bodyguards, seeing as the usual group of [[Shadow Order]] members, led by [[Sai]] were missing.                                  |
| [[Session Notes/Session 2.md\|Session 2]] | [[K]] mentioned to [[Hanako]] that some people seem to not like the [[Shadow Order]] guys in here, which led a cold response and a rant from [[Hanako]] addressed to all customers. |
| [[Session Notes/Session 2.md\|Session 2]] | [[K]] realised that the ceasefire agreement scroll was still present and that it was her scroll that was taken.                                                                     |
