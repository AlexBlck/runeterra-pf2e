## Biography
Was a student at the [[Kinkou Order]] under [[Shen|Master Shen]] together with her friend [[Sai]]. [[Sai]] left a few years back to join the [[Shadow Order]] and since then she's been questioning the non-intervention position of the [[Kinkou Order]]. Finally, she decided to follow [[Sai|Sai's]] footsteps and left the Kinkou. However, she is not convinced she wants to join the Shadow Order. So she has travelled to [[Thanze]], where she has been a guest of [[Sai|Sai's]] for a couple of weeks, gathering her thoughts and planning to visit the [[Temple of Tanjuul]]to have a chat with the [[Shadow Order]].
## Recent Events
