## At the tavern
- The party got a few drinks at the [[Scarlet Sip Tavern]] and met its owner [[Hanako]].
- They noticed that a group of locals is giving a side eye to a couple of [[Shadow Order]] members and ask what's up, earning their trust with free drinks.
- [[Xhokar]] and [[Miyamoto]] had a chat with the [[Shadow Order]] members, who were enjoying their on the house free drinks.
- [[K]] mentioned to [[Hanako]] that some people seem to not like the [[Shadow Order]] guys in here, which led a cold response and a rant from [[Hanako]] addressed to all customers.
	- The locals were no longer eager to talk to the party.
## The ceremony
- In the evening, the party went to the ceremony, held on the [[Rocky Coast]].
- During her speech, [[Lady Kaori Shimida]] revealed that she is planning to sign a ceasefire with [[Noxus]] to prevent further bloodshed and help up a scroll with the agreement.
- At this time, the shots were fired at the three fairies who were providing the musical accompaniment to the event.
- Despite the attempts to protect her, the fourth shot struck [[Lady Kaori Shimida]]
- The fairies came back to life and attacked the party. 
- They summoned an aquatic monster, stole a scroll from [[Lady Kaori Shimida|Lady Kaori's]] body and escaped.
- The party defeated the monster.
	- [[K]] realised that the ceasefire agreement scroll was still present and that it was her scroll that was taken.
- Upon investigation, the party learned that the shots were coming from the direction of the nearby rice farm and that none of the farmer family members were present at the ceremony.
- No [[Shadow Order]] members were present, either. Even though [[Lady Kaori Shimida|Lady Kaori]] mentioned that [[Zed|Master Zed]] himself might attend the ceremony.
